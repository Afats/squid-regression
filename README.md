# Squid Regression

A study in predictive powers of different linear models. Dataset for study is based on squid rostral (beak) lengths, used to see if they are accurate predictor of the size of a squid.

Data is in the R file, but the context of the analysis might not. 


Wonder why you'd need to predict squid sizes.
